Problems that may appear due to lack of transportation:

1)Lack of transportation facilities can lead to rescheduled or missed appointments, delayed care, and missed or delayed medication use.
These consequences may lead to poorer management of chronic illness and thus poorer health outcomes.

2)People may face difficulties in accessing jobs due to lack of public transportation facilities.

For example,lack of transportation can prevent someone from attending a job interview and therefore doom them to a lower status for life.

3)Lack of transport can create external diseconomies by introducing inefficiencies and unreliability 
in the supply chain, making it difficult for assemblers to implement lean production.

4)Lack of transportation can cause students to have numerous absences which could result in their grades falling.
Distance from schools can also be a factor that would prevent students to be able to make it to school.
